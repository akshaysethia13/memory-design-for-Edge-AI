# memory-design-for-Edge-AI
This project was part of the course on Advanced Topics in VLSI, IIT Madras.<br />
The project required designing memory cells for in-memory computation in Edge AI devices. It was a demonstration project designed for MNIST dataset for classification task.
Qunatization of input values and schematic design of a memory blocks were the primary tasks that were completed in the project. The slide in the repository gives a brief outline
of circuit functioning and performance.
